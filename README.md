Fantasy VC sets you as the head of your very own venture capital firm looking to invest in the best companies in order to beat all the competition and establish your reputation as a top VC.

This is a networked desktop Java Application using Java Swing. This repo has to be refactored for it to be deployable (On the back log), but check out some the code and the screens!
